Practical No:2 
Aim: java program for creating backup file of Mysql database. 
Description: 
A data backup is the result of cop ing or archiving files and folders for the purpose of being able to restore them incase of data loss.Data loss can be caused by many things ranging from computer viruses to hardware failures to file corruption to fire,flood,or theft(etc). 
Backup refers to the process of making copies of data or datafiles to use in the event the original data or data files are lost or destroyed.
Secondarily,a backup may refer to making copies for historical purposes,such as for longitudinal studies,statistics or for historical records
or to meet the  requirements of a data retention policy. Many applications, especially in a Windows  environment,produce backup files using
the .BAK file extension.

Backup.java:
Code:
public class Backup {
    public void backupDB(String path){
    String executeCmd="C:/xampp/mysql/bin/mysqldump-uroot-psa-Bstudentdb>"+path; 
    System.out.println(executeCmd); 
    Process runtimeProcess;  
    try {  
        runtimeProcess = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(new String[]{"cmd.exe","/c",executeCmd});
        int processComplete=runtimeProcess.waitFor(); 
        System.out.println(processComplete); 
        if(processComplete==0) 
        { 
         System.out.println("Backup Created Successfully!");
        }  
        else 
        {
         System.out.println("Couldn't Create the backup!");
        } 
    }  
    catch(Exception ex) 
    {
        ex.printStackTrace(); 
    } 
    } 
public static void main(String[] args){ 
new Backup().backupDB("C:/db.sql"); }
}
